# TO DO LIST:
1. Familiarize with the use of Github
2. Learn how to create a Flask project. You will also have to learn basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript
3. Create a framework for the project, and then we will fill in each file with code

# General outline of project:
- Front-end: Website to display data (NBA team win & loss predictions, top fantasy scorers of the night)
- Back-end: Machine learning to make predictions, Algorithms to fetch data, NLP to check headlines for injury

# Basic Functionality:
1. Web application: display predictions for NBA team win & loss and top fantasy scorers of the night in a single scrollable page
2. Web scraper: to grab box score results from basketball-reference.com and an updater that only scrapes the most recent box scores during the start of each day
3. Prediction: Deep learning algorithm to make predictions and performs hyperparameter tuning if given the argument to do so
